        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p><strong>Hopewell Nnaji</strong> is an experienced <strong>Pharmacist</strong> with a high level of proficiency in clinical, hospital and community pharmacy practice. By virtue of my exposure to the pharmaceutical space in the past couple of years, I see the urgent need to fill vacuums. I am of the opinion that the healthcare system in Africa and more so, globally can be better optimized, to yield exponential value to mankind, if properly positioned in the emerging dispensation of technology and innovations. There arises the need for accurate and more precise diagnosis, manufacture and discovery of medicines that have the capacity to trivialize diverse terminal diseases, diabetes, hypertension, cancer, obesity and the likes. We have large volumes of data on therapeutic failures and varieties of drug resistant infections; it is high time we paid maximum and due diligence in our fight for the retention of mankind.</p>
        <p>In this regard, I am more than enthusiastic to reposition myself for empowerment and seek to transition into the sphere of technological advancement. I am passionate about exploring the ecosystems of Software Engineering, Artificial intelligence, Machine Learning and Data Science.</p>
        <p>My experience as a community Pharmacist, has greatly impacted my locale. There has been a positive surge of health awareness and healthy living awakening. Lives have been made to experience the pragmatic effect uninterrupted access to top notch medical services and trustworthy health counsels. I have been able to work in teams of great minds and intellects and have applied my Pharmaceutical care skills to the best of my ability and the remarks and customer feedbacks have been super amazing.</p>
        <p>Moving forward, it is about time I embraced the deeper challenges. It is my desire to see a society, void of terminal infirmities. There is need for more collaboration and affiliation of the health sectors to the emerging technological advancements. I have renewed optimism for the yet to be discovered applications and software testing systems that would eventually align mankind to this path of generational health. I hope to delve into this path as a frontend engineer and build my career towards the backend. I also hope to find a commensurate balance with artificial intelligent systems and machine learning on the long run.</p>
        <p>I am more than happy to reposition with fellow enthusiasts on this path. You are welcome to connect, as we all share from our knowledge banks. Please, feel at home to reach out in every case necessary, as we join hands to make the world a better place. I look forward to connecting with you!!</p>
